dp

from BF to DP:
let's say we have to divided this into d days. 
1. BF: -> DFS.
(start index, remain days). 
    in each recursion, it solve current start index, and remain days.
    thus, we need to solve edge problems: 
    ```
    start index <= total length  &&  remain days<0, invalid.
    ```

    in each recursion, we do iterations, for start index -> last index, we pair (next start, remain - 1)
    we need to memorize the repeated calculation.

```
main function:
    create memo data struction: n,d+1
    fill data struction with flag value.
    do DFS.(start,remain-days,jobDiff,mem)
    and return DFS final result.

DFS fucntion:
    base case 1: if in memo contains, using flag value :(start,remain-days), return that val.
    base case 2: if only 1 day left, iterate and return the max of remaining.
    iteration: from start index, to (all index - remain_days +1 )
        1. get peek Val from start to current index, 
        2. currentResult should be: peek + DFS(current+1, remain_days-1, jobDiff, memo);
        3. the above, do Math.min.
    after-iternation, the currentResult is the min of (start,remain_days). put it to mem and return it.
```
----------------------

bottom up.  
we need to transfer from top-down to bottom-up,  
what is the state transfer? 
d : remain-days; j: job index; currentMin:(j,d) pair.  
The dependency of a currentMin(j,d) only depends on(jj,d-1), where jj>j. 

```
main function:
1. create a DP [days+1][jobs+1]. the reason is that, this is state transfer. for n jobs, we have n states: 0 jobs done and n jobs done. so does days.
2. dp[d][i] only depends on dp[d-1][j] where j>i.  
3. for all j > i, we have equaltion: dp[d][i] = min(daily_job_of_i + dp[d-1][j], dp[d][i])
4. base case, last row is filled with 0, indicating no jobs, job difficulty will all be 0.
```
